    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The iconic green bean casserole is reworked with the flavors of French onion soup -- caramelized onions and Gruyere cheese. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the onions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced lengthwise </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the white sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups milk </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground thyme </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter </li>
        <li>2/3 cup panko bread crumbs </li>
        <li>2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed </li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese, divided </li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir the onions into the pan; cook and stir until very soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in sherry vinegar. Transfer to a small bowl, and reserve.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt 2 more tablespoons butter. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour. Stirring constantly, cook over medium heat until the flour smells like baked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, then whisk in nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and thyme. Bring to simmer, and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, 3 more minutes. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in clean skillet; stir in panko until all crumbs are coated; reserve.</li>
        <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over medium heat, and boil beans until bright green and crisp but not raw tasting, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain very well.</li>
        <li>Spoon half of the caramelized onions into the prepared casserole dish; top with green beans. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread reserved white sauce over the green beans; sprinkle with half of the Gruyere cheese. Top with the rest of the onions, and use the back of a spoon to push onions down into sauce and cheese. Top with the buttered panko crumbs, the remaining Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot throughout and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
